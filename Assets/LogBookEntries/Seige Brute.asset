  description: "Classification/Rank: \u2018Boss\u2019 \r\n\r\nPhysiology: Composed
    of rocks held together by some sort of miasma, the Seige Brute floats through
    some form of alien technology. It uses chunks of its body to unleash devestating
    attacks.\r\n\nBehaviour: The Seige Brute is slow moving, but can be aggravated
    by repeated attacks, in which case it will rush with increasing speed towards
    the offending target. It also hurls rocks at its targets, devestating anything
    in its path."
