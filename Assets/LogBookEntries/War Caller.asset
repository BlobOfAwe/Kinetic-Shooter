  description: "Classification/Rank: \u2018Leader\u2019 \r\n\r\nPhysiology: Upright
    and monocular, this creature can be recognized by its green exoskeleton, scuttling
    arachnid-like legs, and the mysterious light it emits from its stomach and mouth
    while vocalizing.  While the exact source and mechanism of this bioluminescence
    is not yet understood, its effect on nearby units is striking.  The War Caller
    itself has not been observed engaging in direct combat, and its lack of teeth
    and its flipper-like appendages would make it ill-suited for the task.  Given
    the War Caller\u2019s heavy reliance on surrounding creatures, the current hypothesis
    among EPDF xenobiologists is that the War Caller might not be a naturally-occurring
    organism, and has instead been bred or modified to serve this specific purpose.\r\n\r\nBehaviour:
    War Callers emit a bright glow alongside a powerful sonic wave, with a possible
    electromagnetic component.   Depending on the colour and frequency emitted this
    emission has different effects on the surrounding creatures. Calls accompanied
    by a teal light appear to have some form of healing effect.  Orange light speed,
    and damage.\r\n"
