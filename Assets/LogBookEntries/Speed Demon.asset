  description: "Physiology: This creature has arachnid-like legs with razor sharp
    tips designed to implant themselves in its prey, and progressively bite them
    until death. There is no internal means for digestion, suggesting the creature's
    main goal is destruction, not survival.\r\n\r\nBehaviour: This creature runs
    toward its player and attaches to them, doing progressive damage over time until
    it is rammed into a wall, dislodging it from its prey. Keep your distance and
    don\u2019t panic. \r\n"
