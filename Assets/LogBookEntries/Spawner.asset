  description: "This snake-like creature appears to have multiple sections to its
    body, allowing for maneuverability and the productions of smaller creatures while
    it moves. While the Spawner creature itself isn\u2019t too fast, the minlets
    it releases are incredibly fast. Keep track of their whereabouts at all times. "
