  description: "Physiology: This creature is more evidently manufactured than others.
    Looking like a combination of an arachnid and a gun, this creature keeps its
    distance and attacks from afar. It\u2019s best to keep moving until these pests
    are dealt with.\r\n\r\nBehaviour: This creature seems to lack all survival instincts,
    acting more like a machine than an intelligent being. Its single goal is to kill
    its target. It is still a mystery who created the creature but it demonstrates
    an advanced ability to mix biological and mechanical substances.\r\n"
