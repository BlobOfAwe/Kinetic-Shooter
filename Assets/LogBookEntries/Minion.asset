  description: "Physiology: This creature is humanoid in appearance, but seems deeply
    unnatural. It\u2019s disproportionate head is twice the size of its torso and
    it appears to be secreting some form of poison from its mouth. While it\u2019s
    thought that the creature cannot feel emotions, it does appear to have a large
    smile which never fades, even when deceased.\r\n\r\nBehavior: This creature gradually
    moves towards the player and attacks when in reaching distance. It is recommended
    to kill on sight - there is no reasoning with these creatures.\r\n"
