  description: "The FitnessGram\u2122 Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity
    test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.\r\nThe 20 meter
    pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.\r\nThe running speed
    starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.\r\nA single
    lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.\r\nRemember to run in
    a straight line, and run as long as possible.\r\nThe second time you fail to
    complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.\r\nThe test will begin on
    the word start.\r\nOn your mark, get ready, start."
