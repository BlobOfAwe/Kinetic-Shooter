  description: 'Physiology: Traplets have three small mechanical legs which allow
    it to stick to vertical surfaces. They have one ocular organ which appears to
    be human, suggesting some form of genetic manipulation in its creation.



    Behaviour:
    Traplets do not directly damage their victims, but instead plant spikes around
    the area of its victims.'
