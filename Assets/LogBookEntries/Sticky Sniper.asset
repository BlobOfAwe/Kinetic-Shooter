  description: 'Physiology: A variation of the sniper enemy, the sticky snipers are
    identical to normal snipers, but they shoot a projectile which contains some
    form of acid which slowly seeps into its victims skin, doing more damage over
    time. The acid seems to be attached to the sniper entity, as its effect stops
    when the creature is killed.

    

    Behaviour: This creature seems to lack
    all survival instincts, acting more like a machine than an intelligent being.
    Its single goal is to kill its target. It is still a mystery who created the
    creature but it demonstrates an advanced ability to mix biological and mechanical
    substances.
