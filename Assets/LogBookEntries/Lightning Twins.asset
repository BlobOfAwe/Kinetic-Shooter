  description: 'Physiology: These creatures are always spotted in pairs of two, suggesting
    a shared intelligence. They have humanoid bodies but lack any form of humanity.
    No emotions but hatred is displayed on their face.



    Behaviour: They perfectly
    mirror each others movement and have lightning stretching between their bodies,
    damaging all creatures caught in the middle. These creatures intentionally keep
    their distance from their victims, but if one is killed, the other will become
    irate and will charge its victim.'
